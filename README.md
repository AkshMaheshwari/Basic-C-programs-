# Basic-C-programs-
Some C programs for practice :)
<br>
Do make sure to practice some of the programs by yourself and then if you're stuck feel free to use the codes here 
<br>
I will keep updating these documents so no need to worry and if someone feels like adding your own logic feel free to dm me.
<br>
Happy coding guys!
